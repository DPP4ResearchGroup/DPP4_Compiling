abstract = "Comparative genomics is narrowly defined as a research strategy to infer the functions and loci of genes in a target genome from information obtained by analyzing a certain genome. In this report, basic knowledge and concepts for comparative genome analysis are explained. Some representative reports of comparative genomics relevant to each knowledge and concepts are also introduced. Most of these examples focus on the analysis of animal genomes and related evolutionary research; however, the basic ideas behind these examples also apply to other biological taxa."
